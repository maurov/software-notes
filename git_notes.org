* Git(hub) raw notes

I do not use Git so often to remember all the steps to contribute to open-source
projects (usually hosted on Github), so here I write down some notes.

** My Github workflow

- click 'fork' button on the repo you want to contribute to
- clone it locally to your machine
- add upstream track for updates (example on 'pymca' repo)

  git remote add --track master vasole git://github.com/vasole/pymca.git

- to fetch and merge updates from the master original project

  git fetch vasole
  git merge vasole/master

- make a working branch and switch to it

  git branch your_branch_name
  git checkout your_branch_name
  git branch #(this will show all the branches and put * on working one)

- push your local changes to a remote branch

  git push origin your_branch_name

- go to your fork's webpage on Github and click 'pull-request' button give
  pull-request a name, fill in details of what changes you made, click submit
  button.  you're done!!
